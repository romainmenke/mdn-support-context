# MDN Support Context

> Your personal Baseline

This is a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/support-context/dcbelpbochjfadialnomdpnndkmmlpfo) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/support-context/) extension that does two things :
- it removes the Baseline banner from MDN pages
- it adds personalized support information to the page

## Configuration

Go to the extension `Options` to set your [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist)

## Usage

Visit any MDN page and see if a feature is supported in your target browsers.

## Ignored browsers

Not all browsers are supported by MDN and some browsers have incorrect data.

Ignored when giving feedback :
- Android UC
- Android Webview
- Baidu
- Blackberry
- Chrome on Android
- Firefox on Android
- Kaios
- Oculus
- Opera Mini
- QQ

Support data percentages are calculated by taking the coverage of your targets and comparing these to the coverage of the feature.
